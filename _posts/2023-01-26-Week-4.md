# Week 4 - Extending the Functionality and Facing some Challenges

## Seat Maps
This week Nacé has continuiously workedon the seat maps. She has made some significant progress. There are feturs as seat selectiontionand room selection implemented sucessfully. However, there are sill some functionalities to be implemented. Nacé started working on intergrating adding a selected seat to the basket. However she encountered an error. She spent significant time trying to fix the error. However, she was not able to fix it. As a pair we decided to have Scott attempt to resolve the issue. Having resh eyes on the problem proved to be sucessful. Scott was able to fix this issue and make some further improvements to the seat maps. Seat maps are not yet fully fuctional. We are hoping to have them fully functional before the end of next week. The seat maps are currently displayed using a html table with a line defining each seat. We are hoping to implement loops to display the seats in the room using their capacity. This will make the seat maps more dynamic and easier to maintain. Below is a screenshot of what the seat maps currently look like.

## Documentation and Testing
This week we are making a start at documentaion such the user manual, Technical spesification. Making a start on this will put us in a good position when we come to testing and documentation stages of the project. During our meeting with our supervisor this week we ot some clarification on the testing required. We aim to make a start on our user evaluation questionnaire next week. And we also want to start testing on the code and documenting thesetests.

## Booking verfication
This week we also brainstormed methods in which we can verify a booking. We have come up with some possible methods in our meeting with our supervisor. We will be researching the possibility of using a QR code to verify a booking. Our supervisor also suggested potentially using a native app to read the nfc tag on the student's student card. We will also will be researching possibly using the user's google account to verify their booking since we are already are using google accounts for login. We will be researching these methods and will hopefully be making a start on implementing them next week.

## Serializers and nodeJs
This week Scott worked on implenting serializers. He also started some work on nodeJS. However this requires the django elements to be fully functional. We made the decisions to focus on django elements. We will be focussing on completing the django elements before moving on to nodeJS. We hope to have them completed soon and to make a start on nodeJs.

## Next Week
We will be continuing on the seat maps. We will also work on further functionality once we have fully implemented the seat mapping. We will be continuing with the documentation as well as tesing elements. We will be finishing research on the booking verfication methods and will be making a start on implementing them. 

## Conclusion
Overall we are happy with the progress we have made this week. We are happy with our approach to handling errors to ensure significant progress. We hope to report on more functionality progress next week and we hope to have a large portion of documentation completed.
