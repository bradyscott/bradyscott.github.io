# Week 3

Having had our proposal reviewed, we were given the okay by our supervisor to submit it. 

Following this, we did not have anything material to deliver this week. Instead, we allocated some time to getting ready to start working on our functional specification in the coming weeks. We acquired the template from the repo and became acquatined with what information we need to be able to complete it. We spent some time discussing how we would plan to complete each section, and thought some more about our plans for the implementation of WeBook.
