# Week 7 - Completing our Functional Specification

After we completed our functional specification planning last week we started to work on the completion of our functional spesification. We each completed our individual sections and then took some time to review each others changes and give some feedback. Once we were happy with our completed funcftional specfication we met with our supervisor to have him review it. We recieved overall positive feedback regarding our document. Our main items of feedback was to change some wording to be more asertive for example changing "the system will aim to" to "the system will". Our supervisor also suggested to go beyond the specfications for the functional specification and include a database schema. He has given us the go ahead to submit our functional spesification once we implemnt these changes. Thsi week we also completed and submitted the ethics frm to gain ethical approval for the useer testing we will be conducting at a later date. The next phase for us will be to begin development of our system.
