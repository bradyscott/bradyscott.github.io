# Week 2 - Project Proposal

>This week we had a new focus since we had already secured a supervisor. This week we set out to determine the usecases we ragarded the most important for our project. Once we had chosen our usecases the next task was to work on our project proposal.

> We each started working on the proposal on our own branches of the repository. Once each of we completed some sections we submitted merge requests to merge our changes into the project proposal branch. We worked together on completing the proposal and once we had our first draft of the proposal we reviewed it among ourselves and made some changes. 

> After makes these changes we felt our proposal was ready to be reviewed with Steve. We scheduled a meeting in which Steve reviewed our proposal he gave us some small items of feedback but his overall feedback was that our proposal was ready for the master branch. We made the small adjustments based on our feedback and then we merged the proposal in the master branch. Our next task will be presenting our project proposal to the approval panel.
