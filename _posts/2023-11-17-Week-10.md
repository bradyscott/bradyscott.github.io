# Week 10 - Ethical Approval for Testing & Implementation Plans

This week, we got our ethical approval form approved by two members of the ethics committee, meaning that we are now good to go for testing our app on real users and will not need to worry about panicking to get this done when we have the app finished.

We had planned to start some implementation, but unfortunately a build up of other assignments for other modules meant that we were unable to do so. With exams happening soon, it is unlikely we will be able to do any implementation until after closer to the Christmas break. However, we will be able to do some planning and research into the technologies we will be using, such as Docker, MongoDB, and Vue.js.
