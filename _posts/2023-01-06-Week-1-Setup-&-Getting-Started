# Week 1 - Setup & Getting Started
## Setting up Our Blog
For our project, we are required to maintain a blog that details our software engineering process. This is what you're reading right now.

After some careful research, we decided that the simplest and most efficient way for us to manage the blog was by creating a GitHub repository and using Jekyll to generate the static site. We then decided to use GitHub Pages to host the site. This is the first time that we have used Jekyll, so we had to do some research to figure out how to set it up. We followed the instructions on the Jekyll website and were able to get the site up and running in no time.

### Posting Schedule
We aim to try and post every week on a Friday with updates on the progress we have made during that week. This, of course, depends on how well things go for us on each particular week. We will also try to post a blog post every time we make a significant change to the project.

## Django Installation
We began by installing Django and the Django REST Framework onto both of our machines as this is what we had decided in advance to use to make our web app. As Django uses Python, we had to ensure that our Python installation was in order too. Scott ran into some issues on his computer as there were multiple Python versions installed. Long story short, after a few hours of messing around in the terminal, the problematic Python version was removed and he was able to install Django and the Django REST Framework.

## Django Setup
We then set up a new Django project and app. We decided to name our project "backend" and our app "bookDCU". We then created a new Django superuser and ran the server to ensure that everything was working as expected.

## Creating a Basic Web App
We spent some time discussing the various models we would need for our system, such as a user, booking, and room. These were created and we tested to make sure this was successful by ensuring that we could create new users and add rooms in the Django admin panel.

Following this, we decided to pick a task each and go off and work alone for a bit. Nac√© worked on adding "Login with Google" functionality, as DCU accounts are Google accounts and we want our users to be able to login with their DCU accounts.

Scott decided to examine displaying the seat map of a room and figure out how to make it interactive for users so that they can click on a seat and book it.

Both are still work-in-progress and we hope to have more pgrogress to show next week.
