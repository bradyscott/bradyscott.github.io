# Week 3 - Extending the Functionality of bookDCU

This week, we both worked extensively on the functionality of our web app. We have added a lot of new features and improved the existing ones. In this blog post, we will go through the new features we have added and the improvements we have made to the existing ones.

## Choose Date & Time from Homepage
We have added a new feature to the homepage of the web app. Users can now choose a date and time from the homepage and click on the 'Confirm' button to be taken to a page that shows the avilable rooms (for now, all rooms are shown while we work on implementing whether or not a room is available). This was done using a Django form. This differs from last week where the old form simply did nothing and was there for show. Scott worked on this feature, which you can see below.

## Room Display Page
The room display page is where users are taken after they have chosen a date and time from the homepage. This page shows the available rooms for that date and time. The user can then click on a room to be taken to the room page. Compared to last week, this page now shows the date and time the user chose from the homepage in a format that is convenient and clear for users. Scott worked on this feature. You can see the page below (it still has placeholder images, but we hope this will change soon when Nacé wraps up her work on the seat maps—see below!).

## Room Page
When you add a room to your basket, the room page now shows a button that says 'View Basket'. This button takes you to the basket page. This is a new feature that we added this week. Nacé worked on this feature. In addition, a message displays if you try to add the same room to your basket twice. You can see the page below.

## Seat Maps
Nacé spend much of this week working on the seat maps. She has made a lot of progress and the seat map should be ready to go very soon. 

## Upcoming Bookings Page
Bookings made by a user are now displayed on different pages depending on whether they are upcoming or past bookings. This is done by filtering the bookings by date. The upcoming bookings are displayed on the 'Upcoming Bookings' page and the past bookings are displayed on the bookings page. 

In addition, the bookings page now shows the date and time of the booking, along with more useful information. This is a new feature that we added this week. We also added a button to cancel a booking, which removes the booking from the database.

We both worked on this feature. You can see the upcoming bookings page below.

## User Confirmation Emails
Finally, we get to the feature that I am most exicited about. This was a bonus feature that we had not planned to add this week, but Scott tried it and was able to implement it with minimal hassle. This feature sends an email to the user when they make a booking. The email contains the date and time of the booking, the room booked, and the seats booked. In addition, when a user cancels a booking, they receive an email confirming that the booking has been cancelled. The email is automatically sent to the email address associted with the user's Google account, with no need for the user to manually input their email address at any stage. This is a new feature that we added this week. We both worked on this feature. You can see sample emails below.

## Conclusion
Overall, we are very happy with the progress we have made this week. We managed to implement several new features and improve many existing ones. We are looking forward to next week, where we will continue to work on improving the functionality of our web app. We hope to have a fully functioning web app by the end of the project.
