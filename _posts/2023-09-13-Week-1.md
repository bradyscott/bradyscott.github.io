# Week 1 - Finding a Supervisor

This week, we focused our efforts on finding a suitable faculty member to supervise our final year project. We had initially planned to speak to Dr Michael Scriney, but had learned that he would not be taking on any students for supervision this year.

We sent an email to Dr Jennifer Foster as she has some experience with and interest in webapps. We were able to scedule a meeting with Jennnifer, after meeting with her she expressed that she was willing to supervise our project but she believed that someone else might be a better fit for our project. She suggested we reach out to Dr. Stephen Blott or Dr. Darragh O'Brien. We contacted both and we were able to schedule a meeting with Steve during which he gave us some advice on how we can expand the project and agreed to supervise our project. Since we had now chosen to go with Steve as our supervisor we sent an email to Jennifer thanking her for her willingness and advice and informing her that we had chosen to go with Steve as our supervisor.

After being taken on by Steve we made some plans to adjust our project to cater to a wider audience. We decided to make the project an overall booking system that can be used by any university for all bookable locations and events. Our next step is completing the project proposal and having it reviewed by Steve before submitting it.
