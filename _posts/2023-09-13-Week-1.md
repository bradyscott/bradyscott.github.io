# Week 1 - Finding a Supervisor

This week, we focused our efforts on finding a suitable faculty member to supervise our final year project. We had initially planned to speak to Dr Michael Scriney, but had learned that he would not be taking on any students for supervision this year.

We have sent an email to Dr Jennifer Foster as she has some experience with and interest in webapps, and we are awaiting a response.
