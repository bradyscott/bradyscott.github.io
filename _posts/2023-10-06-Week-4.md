# Week 4 - A slow week

This week we did not complete any work on the project as we are now waiting for appproval panels in which we will present our project proposal to the panel. We are expecting our project to be approved we might receive some items of feedback to incorporate into our project. We will be presenting our project proposal next week Wednesday.
