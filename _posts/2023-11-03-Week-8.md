# Week 8 - Beginning the Implementation

Having gotten our functional spec reviewed and approved by our supervisor, we felt confident enough to start looking at the implementation for our project.

We now plan to start making a basic django web app with which we will integrate Vue.js. We will then use this as a testbed to become familiar with how the two technologies work together.

In addition, we plan to explore the usage of Docker to containerise our application, as well as the use of a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of our application. It will also be necessary to look MongoDB and how we can use it to store our data.
