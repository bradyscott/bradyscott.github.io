# Week 5 - Project Approval Panel

This week we presented our project to the project approval panel. Our project was approved by the approval panel so we are now in the clear to start work on our Fuctional Specification. During the approval panels we got some feedback that we found helpful and will have to research and then incorporate into our project. Some of this feedback included: considering use of a scalable database rather than the use of Mongo DB, as well as considering how we will address configurability of the system. In the coming weeks we will be working on completing a first draft of our Functional Specification, once we have completed this we will submit it to our supervisor for review.
