# Week 6 - Starting our Functional Specification

Given that we had received the go-ahead from the project approval panel, we felt that now would be a good time to begin the completion of our functional specification as it would allow us enough time to make any necessary changes before the deadline in early November.

We both met in the library to consider the different sections of the specification that we would need to complete, and laid them out on a whiteboard where we made some bullet points under each.

In addition, we divded the work up with Nac√© doing any headings encased in a purple bracket, and Scott completing any headings with an orange bracket.

We aim to get a first draft of the specification completed by mid-next week so that we can deliver it to Steve Blott for evaulation, following which we will make further changes and refinements before submission.
